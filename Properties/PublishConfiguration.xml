2x Double Parking Lots - for 2 and 4 vehicles;

1x Sideways Parking lot - just for 1 vehicle;

4x Motorbike Parking lot - for 1, 2, 3 and 4 vehicles.

KNOWN ISSUES

These lots have an invisible road build in them, put them too close to each other, in any direction, may cause a malfunction. 
If this occurs, try to change the type of connection (one lane road, one way roads or without pedestrian path). 
If you're familiar with Gizmos - Pathfinding option, you can see if they work properly or not, functional lot will have a black arrows connection to paths, non-functional ones will have a red dot in the center.</LongDescription>
